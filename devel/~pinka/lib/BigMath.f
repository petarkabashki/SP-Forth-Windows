\ Given a number expressed as a ratio of 63-bit unsigned integers,
\ calculates a ratio of 31-bit numbers that very closely approximates the
\ original ratio.  Such 31-bit ratios may then be used with */ for
\ accurate multiplication by "real" constants.
\ 
\ These routines will reproduce, or improve upon, the ratios used in
\ STARTING FORTH, Leo Brodie, p.122. For best results, use the largest
\ values (with the most sig- nificant bits) possible, as in these
\ examples:
\ 
\ 18.84955592 6.00000000 RATIO . . ( Pi, gives 235619449/75000000 )
\ 19.02797280 7.00000000 RATIO . . ( e, gives 11892483/4375000 )

\ DU/MOD Double Unsigned Division with Remainder.  Given an unsigned
\ 2-cell dividend and an unsigned 2-cell divisor,  return a 2-cell
\ remainder and a 2-cell quotient.  The algorithm is based on Knuth’s
\ algorithm in volume 2 of his Art of Computer Programming, simplified
\ for two-cell dividend and two-cell divisor.

\ These words derive 31-bit rational approximations for numbers that
\ start out as 63-bit ratios.  It's useful for coming up with the nice
\ ratios used by  */  for producing the effect of real arithmetic; for
\ the errors in these ratios are often on the order of ten to the minus
\ eighth or better.  The method was pointed out by a nice fellow from
\ Richmond, VA and is far better than the exhaustive searches that were
\ used earlier. In all cases it will produce the same or better ratios for
\ the examples in Starting Forth.  Method derives from Euclid.
\ 
\ RATIO requires that both of its arguments be 63-bit unsigned numbers.
\ It returns a pair of 31-bit unsigned numbers in the same order that are
\ a darned good approximation to the first pair.  Data management will
\ some day be cleaned up if we ever get a  D/  that's fast enough to make
\ this whole procedure attractive for application rather than design time
\ use.
