\ Copyright (c) 1972-1999, FORTH, Inc.
\
\ These simple benchmarks are used for comparisons of FORTH, Inc.
\ implementations.  Execute BENCHMARK to run all of them.  Timing is
\ only as accurate as the granularity of the target's millisecond
\ counter.  This inaccuracy can be reduced when the tests are run for
\ longer periods.  Increase the #TIME constant if you want the timings
\ to be more repeatable.

\ Benchmark support words
\
\ ELAPSED-TIME returns the time in milliseconds that has elapsed
\ between the execution of [$ and $].
\
\ ###,###,###,### formats the given double with the given number of
\ extra triplets.
\
\ SCALE-TIME displays the elapsed time, less the tare time established
\ the first time this routine is called.
\
\ LOOPS returns DO LOOP parameters, keeping limit positive.

\ [$ is the prefix to a testing word.  It sets the starting time and
\ the stack depth and returns the loop parameters.
\
\ STACK-DELTA returns the number of items that have been added to the
\ stack since the execution of [$.
\
\ DROPS discards the items that have been added to the stack.
\
\ $] is the suffix to a testing word.  If the loop count is negative,
\ it determines if we have been executing this test for at least 1 sec.
\ If not, it doubles the loop count and returns false to repeat the
\ test.  Otherwise, it makes the loop count positive, displays the
\ elapsed time and returns true. No display words are executed
\ between [$ and $] to avoid the overhead that this creates
\ on some systems.
\
\ /#LOOPS initializes the loop counter to a negative 16 so that a new
\ baseline will be established by $].
\
\ N/A displays an indication that this test is not available.

\ Core FORTH, Inc. Benchmarks
\
\ This series of tests analyze the Forth primitives.
\
\ $DO$ tests an empty DO LOOP sequence.  This should always be the
\ first test so that it establishes the tare factor.
\
\ $*$ tests the primitive math operator * .
\
\ $/$ tests the primitive math operator / .
\
\ $+$ tests the primitive math operator + .
\
\ $M*$ tests the primitive math operator M* .
\
\ $M+$ tests the primitive math operator M+ .
\
\ $*/$  tests the math primitive */ .  This may or may not tell you
\ how the other math primitives perform depending on how */ has been
\ coded.
\
\ $/MOD$ tests the primitive math operator /MOD .
\
\ $UM/MOD$ tests the primitive math operator UM/MOD .
\
\ $PAUSE$ tests the multitasker loop with PAUSE .  It is assumed that
\ each system tested has the same number of tasks defined in the round
\ robin and that they are doing the same things (i.e. nothing).
\
\ $LOAD$ tests the outer interpreter by loading the 2nd block in the
\ Bench.src file.  It is assumed that block contains stuff that will
\ not accumulate if loaded multiple times.
